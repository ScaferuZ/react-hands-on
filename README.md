# Hands-on React POS

Minimal Vite + React demo for a POS interface using simple `ui` primitives and `lucide-react` icons. The UI is premium, minimalist, two-column: left product grid (cards), right order summary (scroll area).

Install & run:

```bash
cd hands-on-react-pos
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This scaffolding includes small `ui` primitives (`Card`, `Badge`, `ScrollArea`) under `src/components/ui` to mirror a shadcn-like component API while keeping the demo self-contained.
- Add or replace images in `src/data/products.js`.
